# Covid teaching notes Spring 2022

## Teaching modalities
Unless you are teaching an iNet sction of a course, you are expected to teach on-campus this semester. If you are unsure, email Scott.

On campus courses are no longer physically distanced.

## Masking, food and drink in the classroom, on the floor
_Masks are required at all times_ unless you are in a designated eating area and consuming food or a beverage, or alone in a private office. It's not permissable to eat food in class. You may have a sip of a drink and pull your mask down for a moment to do so, but that's about it.

## Office hours
Office hours may happen face-to-face, but they may also may be held remote. It is at your discretion. Regardless of how you do this, students must know the best way to reach you outsiode the classroom.

## Reporting illness
If you are ill, please [use this secure form to alert NYU Health and Wellness](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCvIk6DpqWeFsJT).

## Reporting non-compliance
If you see someone who is not follwing the mask mandate, eating in a non-approved area, or acting in a way that is inappropriate during a pandemic while in an NYU building, get what information you can about the individual and ask them to leave. You should email [covidcompliance@nyu.edu](mailto:covidcompliance@nyu.edu) with whatever information you have about the non-compliant individual(s). You may also contact the [Office of Student Conduct](mailto:student.conduct@nyu.edu) or raise a flag in NYU Connect if it is a student. If it is a faculty or staff member, please contact Scott or Luke.

## What happens if I'm sick/traveling/babysitter cancels?
If you cannot come to campus for any reason, contact idmadvise@nyu.edu and immediately notify all the studnets in your class. For these circumstances you may teach remotely or find a substitute instructor for the missing days.

## Field trips
We can have group field trips or similar experiences this fall, though everyone is expected to adhere to NYU standards for masking, etc. If you want students to visit a site, please keep in mind that some may not be able to attend at all. Those who can attend should obey all COVID and other safety guidelines. [Before you go on a trip, please fill out this survey.](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a66iiwwTV2Ager4)

## On Campus Guests
We are able to allow one-time guests coem into class for guest lecture/crit/etc. No minors, partners, signifigant others, etc are allowed on campus.

## Expectations for students
Faculty may request that students who are supposed to be taking a course in a classroom do so. Students who wanted to participate at a distance or asynchronously would then need to obtain an excused absence for courses they are taking remotely that are 'on-campus'.

The majority of students should be on-campus. The exceptions after the first few weeks are for those who are quarantining/ill. 

## Technology
There is no mandate to use any particular learning management system (LMS). NYU now uses [Brightspace as a LMS](https://brightspace.nyu.edu), which you are welcome to use. Some faculty prefer github, others like wordpress. Use what works best for you.

- [NYU web publishing (for NYU Wordpress sites)](https://wp.nyu.edu/create/) 
- IDM wordpress sites are available for those who want more control over layout. Contact Elton Kwok if you're so inclined.

NYU uses Zoom for remote instruction. You can [find more information at this link](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/meetings-chat-conferencing/nyu-zoom.html)

We have a [service named NYU Stream for sharing videos](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/video-and-media-creation-presentation/nyu-stream.html). You are free to use other services like Youtube and Vimeo as well. 

## Classroom setup
Our physical classrooms have a camera, microphone, speaker, and monitor/projector to accomodate students who cannot physically attend. Last year it was noticiably easier for students in-class to turn on their microphones for Zoom meetings to accomodate remote students than to rely on the omnidirectional mics in the classroom.

## Resources
There are a load of resources that have emerged in the last year+ for online and remote pedagogy. Tandon and NYU have a couple places for instructional support as well.
