# IDM Faculty FAQ

## TLDR Fall 2021
### We changed the name of the program! We're now Integrated Design & Media
### Luke Dubois and Jean Gallagewr are the new co-chairs of TCS, our parenbt department

Classes are expected to be on-campus unless prior arrangements were made. [All faculty, students, and staff must submit proof of vaccination for access to campus](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-requirement.html). Masks are required at all times on campus unless you're in a private office. No eating or drinking (a sip of water during class in fine) allowed except in designated areas.

Some students will be arriving late, some will be remote for the entire semester, but this will be a small number overall.
