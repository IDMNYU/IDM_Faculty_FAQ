# Tandon's Makerspace is open for students in Fall 2020

The MakerSpace will be open to students on campus for all prototyping needs. Reservations can be made on the [Makerspace website](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/) and are required for all trainings, machine use, and workspace, which will allow a safe density of users at all times. They have updated the training process to include a remote and in-person portion, to help users feel more confident when using the machines. They be opening up the training calendar on September 14. Refer to the [Training & Reservation page](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training/) for more information. 

If you want someone from the Makerspace to speak to your class, please contact [tandon-makerspace@nyu.edu](mailto:tandon-makerspace@nyu.edu) to schedule a Zoom presentation.

The team over there has started to [post videos on their Youtube channel showing how to use some of the tools](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbNsooKLjbRgRa8RQoVgAaQ). This might be a useful resource for some.
