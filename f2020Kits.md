# Studnet Equipment Kits Fall 2020 
We can't have a normally functioning equipment room this semester. We were able to get some funding to purchase equipment for students to have for themselves. The deadline for submitting requests has passed. If you need something for yoru class, please contact Scott.

These are being assembed and will be distributed to students on campus when they come to class. For the studnets who are remote this semster we will be mailing them equipment. As of August 25, 2020 a larger amount of materials have arrived, amd we will be working to hget these to your students asap, but it may take a little time. Please be patient!
