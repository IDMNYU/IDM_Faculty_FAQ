# Software

Generally, we will not purchase software for class/student use. That said, we do have a number of things available through NYU and IDM's license server.

* NYU provides [free access to Adobe CC](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/adobe.html) to faculty and staff.

* In AY 2022-2023 we are able to provide free Creative Cloud access to IDM majors. Information on how to access this will be distributed to students directly in the beginning of the semester.

* IDM has a license server for a limited number of seats of specialty software including [Max](http://cycling74.com), [Ableton Live](http://ableton.com), and others. Contact Elton Kwok for more information or if you need assistance with this.

* [NYU has virtualized computer lab with a number of software applications](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/instructional-technology-tools-and-services/virtual-computer-lab.html), including some of the Adobe suite. The old system was function but a bit slow. The new one is uses AWS and promises to be snappier, it launches September 1.
