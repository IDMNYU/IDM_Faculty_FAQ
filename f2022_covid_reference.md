## How to get into 370 Jay 
[Details on the steps to access the building](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/campus-life/building-access.html)

## What to do if you contract covid / are exposed / a studnet is ill
All students, faculty, and employees—regardless of vaccination status—who have symptoms of COVID-19, a diagnosis of COVID-19, or have had a close contact exposure to COVID-19 are [required to complete the self-reporting form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCvIk6DpqWeFsJT). After completing the form, the COVID-19 Prevention & Response Team will follow up with next steps and guidance. It is important that you stay home and avoid contact with others.

If a student discloses their covid status to you, tell them to stay home and fill out the self-reporting form above. If you have recentluy in in close contact with the student, you should also report the possible exposure, and strongly consider taking your class(es) online until you have received a negative PCR test.

## Teaching modalities
Unless you are teaching an iNet (online) sction of a course, you are expected to teach on-campus this semester. If you are unsure, email Scott.

## Masking
_Masks are required at all times in IDM public spaces, studios, and classrooms_
[NYU's full mask policy can be seen here](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/protective-equipment.html) 

The tl;dr of it all is this : in classrooms and other instructional spaces, masks must be worn at all times. This policy applies to our studio spaces, which often act as double duty classrooms and workshop areas.

You may remove your mask in a shared office when you are alone. If there are others present, you should keep your mask on. 

These policies are continually reviewed throughout the semester and may be updated in accordance with University rules. 

## Eating
You may eat in an office if you're by yourself. If there are others present, please move to the cafeteria on the second floor. You are welcome to use the refrigerator (cleaned out weekly on Friday evenings) and microwave, utensils, mugs, etc in the 3rd floor space, but please don't eat in there. 

## Reporting non-compliance
If students aren’t complying with protocols, you should treat them as you would any other student breaking rules and being disruptive to class, up to and including asking them to leave, reporting them to the [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu), or contacting campus safety at 212-998-2222.

## Field trips
We can have group field trips or similar experiences this fall, though everyone is expected to adhere to NYU standards for masking, etc. If you want students to visit a site, please keep in mind that some may not be able to attend at all. Those who can attend should obey all COVID and other safety guidelines. 

## On Campus Guests
We are allowed to have guests on campus. The process is easier than it was last year, but advance notice is still required; same-day visit requests are not permitted. All visitors, vendors, and affiliates must be sponsored by an NYU employee. [The full university policy can be seen at this page.](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/campus-visitors.html) 

Guests must be vaccinated and boosted to visit campus.

## Expectations for students
If a student says they are ill, we must take them at face value. We shouldn't ask them for proof or documentation to be verified by the [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu) unless there is an ongoing or unusual concern. Studnets who miss class are responsible for making up whatever they have missed. If you can make a recording of you class session availabe, please do so. Use your best judgement in this matter, the studnet advocate has been overwhelmed this year with request for extensions, permissiable absences, etc. 

## What if a student is missing multiple class meetings and has let me know they are ill?
The provost's office has shared [this doc on teaching temporarily remote students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_YRVvzu1Eee46ngieEW135CqprlNsgv6rdNGVE9bi4/edit)

## What do I do if I have concerns about the student in general?
Just as in 'regular' times, [please raise a flag in Albert](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/studentSuccess/documents/refresh2020/Faculty_Raise%20a%20Flag(1).pdf), and email the student directly letting them know your concerns and what your expectations are. 

## What happens if I'm sick/traveling/babysitter cancels?
If you cannot come to campus for any reason, contact idmadvise@nyu.edu and immediately notify all the studnets in your class. For these circumstances you may teach remotely or find a substitute instructor for the missing days. We stongly discourage scheduling 'makeup' classes, as it can be difficult to align everyone's time. If you know you will miss a scheduled class meeting ahead of time (due to travel, conferences, etc.) please let the students know far in advance, and let them know what they can expect on that day.

## What to do if a student can't get on campus because of an issue with their ID?
Students should reach out to studentlink@nyu.edu. 

## Syllabi
Prior to the first day of class, [send your syllabus to Eric](mailto:em1680@nyu.edu). You can [use this template which has all the required bits you need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TC-o0l7zGKjCTDUQgUVxkCDgCyZ3gx-bK0zGqDWRgmA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technology
There is no mandate to use any particular learning management system (LMS). NYU now has [Brightspace as a LMS](https://brightspace.nyu.edu), which you are welcome to use. Some faculty prefer github, others like wordpress, some even like Brightspace. Use what works best for you. Need NYU Brightspace Support? [Take a look at the Instructor Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-XiDuK5HFe0i8EhtgvfJI0TBrwy_AdX5HYA39kmYog/edit)

- [NYU web publishing (for NYU Wordpress sites)](https://wp.nyu.edu/create/) 
- IDM wordpress sites are available for those who want more control over layout. Contact Elton Kwok if you're so inclined.

NYU uses Zoom for remote instruction. You can [find more information at this link](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/meetings-chat-conferencing/nyu-zoom.html)

We have a [service named NYU Stream for sharing videos](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/video-and-media-creation-presentation/nyu-stream.html). You are free to use other services like Youtube and Vimeo as well. 

## Office hours
Office hours may happen face-to-face, but they may also may be held remote. It is at your discretion. Regardless of how you do this, students must know the best way to reach you outside the classroom.

## Classroom setup
Our physical classrooms have a camera, microphone, speaker, and monitor/projector to accomodate students who cannot physically attend. Last year it was noticiably easier for students in-class to turn on their microphones for Zoom meetings to accomodate remote students than to rely on the omnidirectional mics in the classroom.
