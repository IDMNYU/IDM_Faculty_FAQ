# Equipment Room Insurance

## IDM equipment room insurance requirement

In order to check things out from the IDM equipment room, students are required to carry insurance for at least $3,000. We need proof of this insurance before you can get the stuff you need to complete your assignments. This does a number of things, but mostly it protects you from having to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket if you break/lose/damage any of the equipment. There's also the added bonus in the recommended insurance below that all of your stuff gets covered too. So if you lose your phone or drop your laptop on the subway tracks, your purchase will be insured and covered.

## HOW DO I GET INSURANCE?
Your family may have insurance that covers material goods, or you may have renters insurance already. If so, bring in a copy of the policy and we’ll check to make sure it’s all good. 

If your insurance doesn’t cover our equipment, or you don’t have it yet, College Student Insurance: http://www.collegestudentinsurance.com can cover you for $90/year. The benefit of this is not only can you check stuff out, but all your personal bellongings are covered too.

What CSI protects against: Theft, Fire, Accidental Damage, Flood, Earthquake, Vandalism, Electrical Damage, Water Damage
