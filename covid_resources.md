# Teaching in Spring 2022
We will be teaching on-campus in the spring of 2022. All of us should be prepared to support a hybrid format at the beginning of the academic year to support some studnets who are quarantined due to recent travel, or unable to get to NYC for the start of the semster due to visa or travel issues. 

Labs and shops will slowly be opening up, but with safety paramount. We will, as always, make the best of this, and I know you will do exceptionally well.
