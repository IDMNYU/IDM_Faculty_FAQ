# Deficiency Notices and absences

* **If a student is not doing well in your course for ANY reason, email the student ASAP, and cc: Eric, Scott, and** **Deanna Rayment,** [**deanna.rayment@nyu.edu**](mailto:deanna.rayment@nyu.edu) who is the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance for NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 
  * **Please do not wait to see if the student will improve.** 
  * **Let them know their deficiencies as soon as it affects their grades substantially, and each time thereafter.**
  * **Please do not wait until the end of the semester or worse AFTER the semester or once the problem has escalated.** 
  * **If in doubt, email Eric, myself, and Deanna \(minus the student\) anyway.**
* I would email the student AND talk to the student \(if you can get a hold of them\) in person privately. You can always reserve the MAGNET conference room through Eric or use an empty classroom. Do this BEFORE the withdrawal date of the course so they have the option to withdraw without an academic penalty.
* If you know a student is failing and you have notified them via email \(see above\), strongly encourage them to WITHDRAW from the course by the NYU withdrawal deadline. Look at the NYU Academic Calendar for this date each semester. This semester the date is **Friday, April 5, 2019**.
* It's recommended that you adding the drop/add and withdrawal dates in your syllabus calendar.
* If after doing all of the above and they deserve a failing grade, give the student the grade they deserve. We do not encourage grade inflation in IDM.

**If a student has an unexcused absence or excessive tardiness**, **immediately after class** **email the student and cc:** **Eric Maiello,** [**eric.maiello@nyu.edu**](mailto:eric.maiello@nyu.edu) **and Scott Fitzgerald,** [**scott.fitzgerald@nyu.edu**](mailto:scott.fitzgerald@nyu.edu). Please do not wait until the semester is winding down or after the problem has escalated. If in doubt, email us \(minus the student\) anyway.

If you are used to giving out deficiency notices at other institutions, NYU Tandon School of Engineering does not use these. Instead, inform the student via email re: grades, absences, etc. as needed and cc: Deanna, Eric, and Scott Fitzgerald.
