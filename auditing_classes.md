#Auditing

The School of Engineering allows students to <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/life/student-resources/registrar/policies#Audit">audit</a> (take without grading/credit) courses. To audit, a student must be active in Albert (with an active program, even if it’s a visiting student program), enroll in a course formally, and then request to change the status to “Audit” through the Registrar. The student does not earn any credits and immediately is assigned a grade of “R”, which is the university-wide grade for Audit. This is non-GPA bearing, and the cost is that of regular tuition.
