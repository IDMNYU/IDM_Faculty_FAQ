#13 week vs. 14 week Calendar

NYU School of Engineering Grad courses, which are normally 3 credit hours have been on a 14 week schedule for some time. 

#### The following does NOT apply to graduate courses. This is for undergraduate courses ONLY!   

##The option of a 13 or 14 week schedule. 

**This policy is complicated, so please read it through carefully.**  

*De Angela's Note: The main thing to remember when reading this is that the final is counted separately than the classes. So if it reads 13 weeks, you should remember it is 13 weeks + a final. If it reads 14 weeks, you should remember it is 14 weeks + a final. Final in IDM means final project and/or final presentation or both.*

NYU in general runs on a 14 week schedule, but the faculty and administration of the School of Engineering decided to retain the option of running undergraduate courses for 13 weeks within the framework of that schedule. The gravamen is that the published calendar is 14-weeks but Poly's class periods are a bit longer than at some other units of NYU, so that you may be able to satisfy course requirements  before the end of the 14th week.

*The actual requirements for contact hours are denominated in minutes, including an extra 120 minutes for a final exam, whether or not you give a final.*

**If you choose, you may run your course for 13 weeks or for 13 1/2 weeks, which will give our students the traditional number of reading days that they have had before finals.**

**If you run your course for 14 weeks.**   
A fourteen week course has 28  sessions, each of 110 minutes. Including the final, the total comes to  3200 minutes. So if there's a snow day, or the instructor is ill, there's a built-in extra make-up of two classes minus ten minutes.  

**A thirteen week course has 26 sessions, each of 110 minutes.** Including the final, the total comes to 2980 minutes. For this option you will have to make-up a total of 20 additional minutes, which you can make up in an informally at the discretion of the instructor.  It does not have to be a 20 minute bloc. So, for example, you could ask your students to stay on for five minutes during four classes. Or you can run 27 sessions, which totals  3090 minutes with the 120 minute final period.   

There are three options that are permissible:

1. 28 sessions--with 200 extra minutes (just ten minutes short of two classes) to cover make ups.
2. 27 sessions, with a 90 minute cushion, so if you miss a session, you will only have to  make up 20 minutes.
3. 26 sessions with a 20 minute makeup required divided in any way so long as it's before the end of the semester, at the instructor's discretion.
