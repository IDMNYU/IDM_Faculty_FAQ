# Software

Generally, we will not purchase software for class/student use. That said, we do have a number of things available through NYU and IDM's license server.

* NYU provides [free access to Adobe CC](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/adobe.html) to all students, faculty and staff.
* IDM has a license server for a limited number of seats of specialty software including [Max](http://cycling74.com), [Ableton Live](http://ableton.com), and others. Contact Elton Kwok for more information or if you need assistance with this.
* [NYU has virtualized computer lab with a number of software applications](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/instructional-technology-tools-and-services/virtual-computer-lab.html), including some of the Adobe suite. The old system was function but a bit slow. The new one is uses AWS and promises to be snappier, it launches September 1. 

# Hardware

We have a number of high-end 3D workstations int he XR lab. These computers are primarily for use by students in VR/AR/3D and Motion Capture classes. During the pandemic, we are offering remote access to these machines through a browser based interface. If your class requires this, please contact Gabriella and Elton.
