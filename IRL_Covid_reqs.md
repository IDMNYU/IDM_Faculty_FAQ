# Access to campus
You _must be vaccinated_ to come to campus. [NYU has a page detailing the process for gainingÂ access to campus and sumbitting proof of vaccination](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-requirement.html). If you are a faculty member and cannot be vaccinated for religious or medical reasons, you will need to be tested regularly.

[Visit the student health portal to check the status of your vaccination](https://shcportal.nyu.edu/login_directory.aspx)

Every day, _before coming to campus_, you must [complete the NYU Daily Screener](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ePNv0eXvGWgCxkq?) and show the green check with today's date to security as you enter the building.
