# Classroom technology
NYU Classroom Media Services will assist with the instructional technology equipment and services in the classrooms in these two facilities beginning fall 2019.  Tandon Media Services will support classrooms at other Tandon buildings (Rogers Hall, Jacobs, Dibner, etc.).

The classrooms on the 3rd (307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313) and 4th (407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413) floors have two flat-panel monitors, with wall mounted HDMI connections. Wireless Presentation (Solstice) is also available for interactive student participation.

NYU Classroom Media’s Brooklyn satellite office is at 2 MetroTech Center, Room 809. There are two technicians -- Adrian Enrique Rivera (Daytime) and Patrick Julien (Evening) – both with extensive backgrounds in the AV and IT professions. The staff can be reached at 646-997-0766 for assistance in our supported classrooms. Hours of service are Monday to Thursday, 8:00 am to 10:00 pm and Friday, 8:00 am to 7:00 pm. Please visit http://library.nyu.edu/services/campus-media/classroom-services/ for more information.

If users experience equipment problems or operational issues during class they should contact us by calling 646-997-0766. A technician will arrive at the classroom as soon as possible, often within minutes.
Additionally, we provide equipment demonstrations for classroom instructional technology throughout the year when the classroom is available or 15 minutes prior to the start of your class. Please submit a website request at Reserve Classroom Equipment to arrange a one-on-one demonstration or call us at 212-998-2655 for more information.
We also offer informational sessions before the start of each semester (see below for more.)
