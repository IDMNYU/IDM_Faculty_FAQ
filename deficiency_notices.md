# Deficiency Notices

If you are used to giving out deficiency notices at other institutions, NYU Tandon School of Engineering does not use these. Instead, inform the student via email re: grades, absences, etc. as needed and **cc: Judith Simonsen, js6244@nyu.edu,** who is the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance for NYU Tandon School of Engineering as well as Eric Maiello, eric.maiello@nyu.edu and IDM Co-Director, De Angela L. Duff, deangela.duff@nyu.edu.

**In fact if a student is NOT doing well in your course for ANY reason, e**mail the student and cc: Eric, De Angela, andÂ Judith Simonsen ASAP. Please do not wait until the end of the semester or worse after the semester or after the problem has escalated. If in doubt, email us \(minus the student\) anyway.
