# Class Funds

*Previously*, the TCS Department provided up to $300 per class for field trips, class activities, food, guest lecturers, guest critics, etc. Thsi was not to be used for books, equipment, paying for a sub, etc. Starting late 2019, this was entriely offloaded to IDM. 

With our budget for 2019/2020 comepletely unknown at this time, we cannot assume these funds will be avaiable. Once the semester begins, we will be able to suss out what sort of support we can provide. If you would like to be considered for this if available, pleae fill out this form as soon as possible : https://forms.gle/EiJJmNvUAx5iY9YD9

**To request reimbursement following approval**, please provide any receipts with a description of what the funds were used for to Paulette Bancroft, pbancrof@nyu.edu and cc: shf220@nyu.edu. 

**If you have an approved guest lecturer**, after the lecture has taken place please email Scott, Paulette, and the guest lecturer with the following : 

* the name of the guest, 
* the guest's contact information,
* the date of the class, 
* the course number and name 

Paulette, will subsequently send a W9 to the guest so that they can receive the stipend. If they are already employed by NYU, a W9 is not necessary.
