# Class Funds

We are able to provide up to $200 per course for currcular needs. _Funding is limited only to guest speakers/critics and classroom materials. As food is currently prohibited in classrooms these funds cannot be used for - say - a pizza party. If you have specific technical or material needs, please contact Scott and idmtech@nyu.edu_ If you would like to apply for available funds, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/Eyyi9gsSE5kDhF8S7) as soon as possible and notify Scott once you have done so. We _cannot_ purchase gift cards as compensation. Individuals must be US residents or able to work for any employer in the US to receive compensation.

**If you have an approved guest lecturer**, after the lecture has taken place please email Scott, Paulette, and the guest lecturer with the following : 
* the name of the guest, 
* the guest's contact information,
* the date of the class, 
* the course number and name 

Paulette will subsequently send a W9 to the guest so that they can receive the honoraria. If they are already employed by NYU, a W9 is not necessary.
