# TCS Class Funds

The TCS Department can provide funds to support TCS \(including Integrated Digital Media\) courses, **up to $300 per class.** Funds can be used for field trips, class activities, food, guest lecturers, etc. Funds cannot be used for books, equipment, paying for a sub, etc.

You must apply for funds before April 1. It's recommended to do it at the begimnning of the semester before the funds are cut off. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH3bWurEYXQPw-BKDbmMY7p2o0nQatNQj2jPh-6jgmMvkeTg/viewform

Paulette Bancroft may or may not be able to charge a field trip in advance. If she can not, you can be reimbursed.

**To request reimbursement**, please give receipt\(s\) along with a description of what the funds were used for to Paulette Bancroft, pbancrof@nyu.edu, Dibner / 5 MetroTech, LC 130B. Specifically state you'd like to use your **TCS Class Funds**; otherwise, she will charge the IDM operating budget and these are two separate budgets.

**If you have a guest lecturer**, email Paulette Bancroft, pbancrof@nyu.edu \(and cc: the guest\) AFTER the lecture has taken place:

* the name of the guest, 
* the date of the class, 
* the course number and name, and 
* specifically state you'd like to use your **TCS Class Funds** for a guest lecturer.

Paulette, will subsequently send a W9 to the guest so that they can receive the stipend. If they are already employed by NYU, a W9 is not necessary.
