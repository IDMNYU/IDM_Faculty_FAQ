# Access to campus
You _must be vaccinated_ to come to campus. [NYU has a page detailing the process for gainingÂ access to campus and sumbittig proof of vaccination](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-requirement.html) If you are not a faculty member but need access to school, there is not currently a mechanism to get your vaccination information and you will need to be tested regularly to come in. If you are a faculty member and cannot be vaccinated for religious or medical reasons, you will need to be tested- information on the testing process is forthcoming.
