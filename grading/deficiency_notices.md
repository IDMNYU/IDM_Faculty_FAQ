# What to do if a student is not performing to expectations

We take our student's behavior, work, and attendance seriously at IDM. You are welcome to contact us through idmadvise@nyu.edu with concerns about students, but **please use [NYU Connect](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-success/nyu-connect/faculty.html) to formally track issues**. This allows us to keep tabs on students in a more robust and holistic fashion than we were able to before.

NYU has a surprisingly good tutorial on how to use this system : [https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/albert-help/training/faculty/advisor-alerts.html](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/albert-help/training/faculty/advisor-alerts.html)

_In addition_ to NYU Connect : 

* **If a student is not doing well in your course for ANY reason, email the student ASAP, cc: idmadvise@nyu.edu and eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu** 
  * **Please do not wait to see if the student will improve.** 
  * **Let them know their deficiencies as soon as it affects their grades substantially, and each time thereafter.**
  * **Please do not wait until the end of the semester or worse AFTER the semester or once the problem has escalated.** 
  * **If in doubt, email the admin team, myself, and the student advocate \(minus the student\) anyway.**
* I would email the student AND talk to the student \(if you can get a hold of them\) privately. Do this BEFORE the withdrawal date of the course so they have the option to withdraw without an academic penalty.
* If you know a student is failing and you have notified them via email \(see above\), strongly encourage them to WITHDRAW from the course by the NYU withdrawal deadline. Look at [the NYU Academic Calendar for this date each semester](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/academic-calendar.html#Spring_2022). This semester the date is **May 3, 2022**.
* It's recommended that you add the drop/add and withdrawal dates in your syllabus calendar.
* If after doing all of the above and they deserve a failing grade, give the student the grade they deserve.

**If a student has an unexcused absence or excessive tardiness**, immediately after the missed class **email the student and cc: idmadvise@nyu.edu.** Please do not wait until the semester is winding down or after the problem has escalated. If in doubt, email us \(minus the student\) anyway. You can always raise a flag and/or commend a student in Albert too.

The [Office of Student Success](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-success.html) is an additonal resource you can point your students to if the need help that seems beyond your capacity. Encourgae students to reach out to studentsuccess@nyu.edu for assistance.
