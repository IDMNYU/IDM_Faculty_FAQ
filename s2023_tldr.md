## Masking
Masks are not required, but encouraged. You may not enforce maksing or non-masking.

## On Campus Guests 
We are allowed to have guests on campus. Advance notice is still required. All visitors, vendors, and affiliates must be sponsored by an NYU employee. 
At least one business day before your guest is to come to campus, [you must fill out the NYU Visitor Request Form](https://veoci.com/v/p/119522/workflow/z8wcftjfe7p3). You will receive a notification email confirming the request has been submitted.

After a request has been made, an email will be sent to the visitor - they must show this to the guard downstairs when they arrive. Someone needs to meet your guest at the entrance and see them in.

All visitor, vendor, and affiliate access request emails are generated from an automated system called VEOCI. If you or your sponsored person(s) have not received an email as expected, please search for “NYU Campus Safety” or ”Veoci”.

## Getting help for students
The [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu) 

## Field trips
We can have group field trips or similar experiences this spring.

## Expectations for students
If a student says they are ill, we must take them at face value. We shouldn't ask them for proof or documentation to be verified by the [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu) unless there is an ongoing or unusual concern. 

Students who miss class are responsible for making up whatever they have missed. If you can make a recording of you class session availabe, please do so. Use your best judgement in this matter, the student advocate has been overwhelmed this year with request for extensions, permissiable absences, etc. 

## What do I do if I have concerns about a student in general? They have missed multiple classes with no notice, not turned in homework, etc?
[Raise a flag in Albert which will alert the student's academic advisor](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/studentSuccess/documents/refresh2020/Faculty_Raise%20a%20Flag(1).pdf). This system helps keep tabs on students across multiple seections and years and will notify any other offices that need to be notified (For example, Health & Wellness, the Center for Student Success, etc). Additionally, email the student directly letting them know your concerns and what your expectations are. 

## What if a student is missing multiple class meetings and has let me know they are ill?
The provost's office has shared [this doc on supporting temporarily remote students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_YRVvzu1Eee46ngieEW135CqprlNsgv6rdNGVE9bi4/edit)

## What happens if I'm sick/traveling/babysitter cancels?
If you cannot come to campus for any reason, contact idmadvise@nyu.edu and notify all the students in your class. For these circumstances you may teach remotely or find a substitute instructor for the missing class meetings. We stongly discourage scheduling 'makeup' classes, as it can be difficult to align everyone's time. If you know you will miss a scheduled class meeting ahead of time (due to travel, conferences, etc.) please let your students know far in advance and communicate to them know what they can expect on that day.

## What to do if a student can't get on campus because of an issue with their ID?
Students should reach out to studentlink@nyu.edu. 

## Syllabi
Prior to the first day of class, [send your syllabus to Eric](mailto:em1680@nyu.edu). You can [use this template which has all the required bits you need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TC-o0l7zGKjCTDUQgUVxkCDgCyZ3gx-bK0zGqDWRgmA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Office hours
Office hours may happen face-to-face, but they may also may be held remote. It is at your discretion. Regardless of how you do this, students must know the best way to reach you outside the classroom on a regular basis.

## Classroom setup
Our classrooms on the 3rd floor of 370 Jay Street are managed by Tandon Media Services and have whiteboards, a camera, microphone, speakers, and monitor. The third floor classroms now have a podium for lectures that also support Zoom. [Tutorials and training materials can be found online.](https://engineering.nyu.edu/services/media-services/tutorials)

## COVID-19 Policies 
[NYU's primary COVID-19 Info pages](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information.html)

## What to do if you test positive for covid
If you test positive, you are required to isolate until you are no longer infectious, regardless of your vaccination status. You are not permitted to enter NYU buildings or participate in NYU-sponsored in-person activities until you meet the criteria for ending isolation.

You must [complete the COVID-19 Report Form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCvIk6DpqWeFsJT)

If a student discloses their covid status to you, tell them to stay home and fill out the self-reporting form above. If you have recently in in close contact with the student, you should also report the possible exposure, and strongly consider taking your class(es) online until you have received a negative PCR test.

## Univeristy Technology
There is no mandate to use any particular learning management system (LMS). NYU now has [Brightspace as a LMS](https://brightspace.nyu.edu), which you are welcome to use. Some faculty prefer github, others like wordpress, some even like Brightspace. Use what works best for you. Need NYU Brightspace Support?
