## COVID-19 Policies 
[NYU's primary COVID-19 Info pages](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information.html)

## What to do if you tes positive for covid
If you test positive, you are required to isolate until you are no longer infectious, regardless of your vaccination status. You are not permitted to enter NYU buildings or participate in NYU-sponsored in-person activities until you meet the criteria for ending isolation.

You must [complete the COVID-19 Report Form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bCvIk6DpqWeFsJT)

If a student discloses their covid status to you, tell them to stay home and fill out the self-reporting form above. If you have recentluy in in close contact with the student, you should also report the possible exposure, and strongly consider taking your class(es) online until you have received a negative PCR test.

## Masking
_Masks are required at all times in IDM public spaces, studios, and classrooms_
[NYU's full mask policy can be seen here](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/covid-related-guidance/protective-equipment.html) 

The tl;dr of it all is this : in classrooms and other instructional spaces, masks must be worn at all times. This policy applies to our studio spaces, which often act as double duty classrooms and workshop areas.

You may remove your mask in a shared office when you are alone. If there are others present, you should keep your mask on. 

These policies are continually reviewed throughout the semester and may be updated in accordance with University rules. 

## Eating
You may eat in an office if you're by yourself. If there are others present, please move to the cafeteria on the second floor. You are welcome to use the refrigerator (cleaned out weekly on Friday evenings) and microwave, utensils, mugs, etc in the 3rd floor space. 

## Reporting non-compliance
If students aren’t complying with protocols, you should treat them as you would any other student breaking rules and being disruptive to class, up to and including asking them to leave, reporting them to the [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu), or contacting campus safety at 212-998-2222.

## Field trips
We can have group field trips or similar experiences this fall, though everyone is expected to adhere to NYU standards for masking, etc. If you want students to visit a site, please keep in mind that some may not be able to attend at all. Those who can attend should obey all COVID and other safety guidelines. 

## On Campus Guests (subject to change soon!)
We are allowed to have guests on campus. Advance notice is still required; same and next-day visit requests are not permitted. All visitors, vendors, and affiliates must be sponsored by an NYU employee. [The full university policy can be seen at this page.](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/campus-visitors.html) 

Guests must be vaccinated and boosted to visit campus. 

At _least_ one week before your guest is to come to campus, [you must to fill out the NYU Visitor Request Form](https://veoci.com/v/p/119522/workflow/z8wcftjfe7p3). You will receive a notification email confirming the request has been submitted.

After a request has been made, a form will be sent to the visitor to enter their information and upload proof of vaccination. Once approved, you and your visitor will receive notification. 

All visitor, vendor, and affiliate access request emails are generated from an automated system called VEOCI. If you or your sponsored person(s) have not received an email as expected, please search for “NYU Campus Safety” or ”veoci”.

## Expectations for students
If a student says they are ill, we must take them at face value. We shouldn't ask them for proof or documentation to be verified by the [office of student advocacy](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu) unless there is an ongoing or unusual concern. 

Students who miss class are responsible for making up whatever they have missed. If you can make a recording of you class session availabe, please do so. Use your best judgement in this matter, the student advocate has been overwhelmed this year with request for extensions, permissiable absences, etc. 

## What do I do if I have concerns about a student in general? They have missed multiple classes with no notice, not turned in homework, etc?
[Raise a flag in Albert which will alert the student's acadsemic advisor](https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/studentSuccess/documents/refresh2020/Faculty_Raise%20a%20Flag(1).pdf). This system helps keep tabs on students across multiple seections and years and will notify any other offices that need to be notified (For example, Health & Wellness, the Center for Student Success, etc). Additionally, email the student directly letting them know your concerns and what your expectations are. 

## What if a student is missing multiple class meetings and has let me know they are ill?
The provost's office has shared [this doc on supporting temporarily remote students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_YRVvzu1Eee46ngieEW135CqprlNsgv6rdNGVE9bi4/edit)

## What happens if I'm sick/traveling/babysitter cancels?
If you cannot come to campus for any reason, contact idmadvise@nyu.edu and immediately notify all the students in your class. For these circumstances you may teach remotely or find a substitute instructor for the missing days. We stongly discourage scheduling 'makeup' classes, as it can be difficult to align everyone's time. If you know you will miss a scheduled class meeting ahead of time (due to travel, conferences, etc.) please let the students know far in advance, and communicate to them know what they can expect on that day.

## What to do if a student can't get on campus because of an issue with their ID?
Students should reach out to studentlink@nyu.edu. 

## Syllabi
Prior to the first day of class, [send your syllabus to Eric](mailto:em1680@nyu.edu). You can [use this template which has all the required bits you need](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TC-o0l7zGKjCTDUQgUVxkCDgCyZ3gx-bK0zGqDWRgmA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Technology
There is no mandate to use any particular learning management system (LMS). NYU now has [Brightspace as a LMS](https://brightspace.nyu.edu), which you are welcome to use. Some faculty prefer github, others like wordpress, some even like Brightspace. Use what works best for you. Need NYU Brightspace Support? [Take a look at the Instructor Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-XiDuK5HFe0i8EhtgvfJI0TBrwy_AdX5HYA39kmYog/edit)

- IDM wordpress sites are available for those who want more control over layout. Contact Elton Kwok if you're so inclined.

NYU uses Zoom for remote instruction. You can [find more information at this link](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/meetings-chat-conferencing/nyu-zoom.html)

We have a [service named NYU Stream for sharing videos](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/video-and-media-creation-presentation/nyu-stream.html). You are free to use other services like Youtube and Vimeo as well. 

## Office hours
Office hours may happen face-to-face, but they may also may be held remote. It is at your discretion. Regardless of how you do this, students must know the best way to reach you outside the classroom.

## Classroom setup
Our classrooms have whiteboards, a camera, microphone, speakers, and monitor. The third floor classroms now have a podium for lectures that also support Zoom. [A training for the 3rd floor clasrooms is happening Wednesday August 31 from 2:00 - 3:00 PM in 370 Jay Street - Room 307.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-jB-yDQZsUec4E5xTQlXfJGQx2N09CUsQ4IKJR4dMDo/viewform?__s=3p2wgvfhy2jqv5gzbszs&edit_requested=true)
