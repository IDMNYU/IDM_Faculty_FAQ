# Adjunct Offices

**IDM Adjunct Faculty Office \(370 Jay Room 344\)**

This is a shared space with 4 desks, and bookshelves. You're welcome to use this as you see fit, though as it is a common space, we encourage you to not leave personal belongings there for an extended period of time (i.e. overnight, unattaneded for hours on end)

**Technology, Culture, and Society \(TCS\) Adjunct Faculty Office \(LC 143\),**  
**5 MetroTech Center, 1st floor**

All TCS adjunct faculty members may use LC 143 as office space. There are two computers available with printer and Internet access. You may request a key from Paulette Bancroft, TCS' administrative assistant, pbancrof@nyu.edu. Keys should be returned at the end of the semester.

Under no circumstances may students be left alone in this room; this is a faculty-only space. Adjunct faculty members are responsible for adhering to the NYU School of Engineering policy of Information Technology Acceptable Use.
