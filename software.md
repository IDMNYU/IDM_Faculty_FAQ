# Software

Generally, we will not purchase software for class/student use. That said, we do have a number of things available through NYU and IDM's license server.

* NYU provides [free access to Adobe CC](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/adobe.html) to faculty and staff.

* In AY 2022-2023 we are able to provide free Creative Cloud access to IDM majors and minors. Information on how to access this will be distributed to students directly in the beginning of the semester. If you have a student from another program/department/school who is not an IDM minor in your class, we cannot provide them a license. They shoukd speak with their home academic department about securing the software. 

* IDM has a license server for a limited number of seats of specialty software including [Max](http://cycling74.com), [Ableton Live](http://ableton.com), and others. Contact Elton Kwok for more information or if you need assistance with this.

# Hardware

Students have access to iMacs in Room 325 and a number of high-end 3D workstations. These Windows computers are primarily for use by students in VR/AR/3D and Motion Capture classes. Other computers, and what was once known as the XR lab has primarily moved to the Navy Yard location.
