Teaching in the time of COVID-19 requires even more patience and dedication than usual. We need to be compassionate, work in multiple modalities, and be flexible in ways that were competely foreign to us at the beginning of this calendar year. We will be working on-campus / online / in a hybrid format, and with students scattered aroudn the globe in time zones with different needs and capacities. There will not be free form access to the labs and shops, we will have to work in ways that are safe, and not necessarily in-line with how we are accustomed to handling our classes. That said, we will make the best of this, and I know you'll all do exceptionally well.

# IDM Labs and studios
We are finalizing lab and studio access protocols. 

The large open studios are converted into physically disatnced classrooms. We are determining of we can use these also as safe spaces for studnets to work 

The *Adjunct Office* is room 344. You will be able to work in there, but only a limited number of people will be allowed at any given point in time. We are working on a scheduling solution for this space.

The *Visitors Office* is room 346. You will be able to work in there, but only a limited number of people will be allowed at any given point in time. We are working on a scheduling solution for this space.

Room 348 is the *XR Lab* with VR/AR/MR tools. We will be providing remote access to students to use the workstations in this room.  

Room 351 is the *Print lab* with a large format printer, Risograph, and other print making tools. We are finalizing lab access protocols for this space.

Room 337 (dividing the two large studios) is our *Proto Lab*. 3d printers, desktop CNC, and electronic fabrication can be found here. There will be limited availability in this space, but students and faculty will be able to do some work there.
