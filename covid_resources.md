# Teaching in Fall 2021
We will be teaching primarily on-campus in the fall of 2021. Some of you indicated in may that you oculd support remote students as well (thank you!). All of us shoudl be prepared to support a hybrid format at the beginning of the academic year to support some studnets who are quarantined due to recent travel, or unable to get to NYC for the start of the semster due to visa or travel issues. 

Labs and shops will slowly be opening up, but with safety paramount. We will, as always, make the best of this, and I know you will do exceptionally well.
