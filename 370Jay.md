The large open studios (Rooms 325, 325A, 340, 340A) are spaces for students to work.

The *Adjunct Office* is room 344. You will be able to work in there. If you are alone with the door closed, you may be unmasked. If more than one person is in the room, you must have a mask on.

NYU Classroom Media Services will assist with the instructional technology equipment and services in the classrooms in these two facilities beginning fall 2019.  Tandon Media Services will support classrooms at other Tandon buildings (Rogers Hall, Jacobs, Dibner, etc.).

The classrooms on the 3rd (307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313) and 4th (407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413) floors have a flat-panel monitor, speakers, and a camera. The 3rd floor classrooms have podiums and HDMI cables for faculty to present from if desired.
