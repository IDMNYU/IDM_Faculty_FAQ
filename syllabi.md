# Syllabus

You may format your syllabus however you like. However, it must contain some essential information. It needs to include basics like the course name, course number, section, meeting pattern (days and times), and your contact information. It must also have any pre-requisites, the course description, a description of the class structure, and learning objectives for the program and course. Other items like grading and attendance, required books/software/hardware, a statement about academic accomodations, and a weekly schedule round out the requirements. [There is a template  for you to work from](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TC-o0l7zGKjCTDUQgUVxkCDgCyZ3gx-bK0zGqDWRgmA/edit?usp=sharing) in the [shared IDM Faculty Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LSAL0-JkUvCeaEEnBFLSszpnENd_aGxd?usp=sharing).
