# Studnet Equipment Kits Spring 2021 
We can't have a normally functioning equipment room this semester. 
Last semster, we were able to distribute materials to students in *some* courses. We'll be doing the same again this semester. These are being assembed and will be distributed to students *after* the drop/add period has passed. If you require us to send specialized materials to your students and this has been cleared with IDM faculty already, please refrain from having any assignments duringt e3h first 3 weeks that would rely on these materials.
