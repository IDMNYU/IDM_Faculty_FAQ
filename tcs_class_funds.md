#TCS Class Funds

The TCS Department can provide funds to support TCS (including Integrated Digital Media) courses, **up to $300 per class.** Funds can be used for field trips, class activities, food, guest lecturers, etc. Funds cannot be used for books or equipment. 

Paulette Bancroft may or may not be able to charge a field trip in advance. If she can not, you can be reimbursed.

**To request reimbursement**, please give receipt(s) along with a description of what the funds were used for to Paulette Bancroft, pbancrof@nyu.edu, Dibner / 5 MetroTech, LC 130B. Specifically state you'd like to use your **TCS Class Funds**; otherwise, she will charge the IDM operating budget and these are two separate budgets.

* You can also check and see if Eric Maiello, eric.maiello@nyu.edu, has enough petty cash to cover the cost of a field trip. If so, give the receipt(s) to Eric, and he will process the reimbursement for the petty cash. **(Petty Cash is NOT a separate pool of funds apart from the $300 class budget. This is only a possible option if you do not want to use your own credit card and get reimbursed.)**

**If you have a guest lecturer**, email Paulette Bancroft, pbancrof@nyu.edu (and cc: the guest) AFTER the lecture has taken place: 
* the name of the guest, 
* the date of the class, 
* the course number and name, and 
* specifically state you'd like to use your **TCS Class Funds** for a guest lecturer.

Paulette, will subsequently send a W9 to the guest so that they can receive the stipend. If they are already employed by NYU, a W9 is not necessary.
