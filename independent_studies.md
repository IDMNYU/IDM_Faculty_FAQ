#Independent Studies

Independent Studies are student-driven, semester long projects carried out under the supervision of a faculty member. Students are to contact the Professor with a project proposal they are interested in. The Professor and student then discuss relevant information, such as meeting times, term deliverable, and semester milestones (weekly progress, midterm status, etc.). 

*You are not required to accept an independent study. It is ultimately up to you.*

Independent Studies operate differently than a full on class, in that the structure is determined by the professor(s) and student. You do not have to meet for 3 hours each week (unless you want to), and can determine meeting days/times based on what works for everyone involved. You and the student could meet: 
* every week
* biweekly
* once a month
* 3 times (at the beginning, during the middle, and at the end) or
* however you both decide.

The main thing is that the work that the student does must merit 3 credits (unless otherwise specified), so the work for the semester should justify this (a good measure is a 3 credit class has 60 working hours/term). Additionally, the goal of an Independent Study should be for advancement of skills/interest outside of what is covered in our course offerings.
