# Deficiency Notices

**If a student is NOT doing well in your course for ANY reason**, **email the student and cc:** **Deanna Rayment,** [**deanna.rayment@nyu.edu**](mailto:deanna.rayment@nyu.edu)**,** the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance for NYU Tandon School of Engineering, **as well as Eric Maiello,** [**eric.maiello@nyu.edu**](mailto:eric.maiello@nyu.edu) **and IDM Co-Director, Scott Fitzgerald,** [**scott.fitzgerald@nyu.edu**](mailto:scott.fitzgerald@nyu.edu). Please do not wait until the end of the semester or worse after the semester or after the problem has escalated. If in doubt, email us \(minus the student\) anyway.

If you are used to giving out deficiency notices at other institutions, NYU Tandon School of Engineering does not use these. Instead, inform the student via email re: grades, absences, etc. as needed and cc: Deanna, Eric, and Scott Fitzgerald.
