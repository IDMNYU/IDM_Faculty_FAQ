# Teaching modalities
We have three instructional methods this semester. If you are unsure what method you are doing, check Albert https://albert.nyu.edu,  If you're still not sure, contact either Scott or Eric.

- Online/Remote - this mode is similar to what we all did in the second half of the spring. 
- On-campus - this is what we are accustomed to, but the classrooms will be larger. Only classes of 15 or less meet in this format. On the first day of class, your students will be asked to pick a seat and stay there for the remainder of the semster.
- Hybrid - this combines both of the other modes and has a weird twist. Your class will meet on campus, but you do not have to meet on campus every meeting. If your class has more than 15 students, you will not meet with all your students every class session. The expectation is that some students will show, and others will join remotely. There will be an app published by the university that will allow studnets to decide when they come to campus for class. Specifics of this are forthcomiong.

# Expectations
We are expected to provide materials for students who may not be able to come to class. These accomodations are designed with student flexibility in mind. A student my be in a different time zone, unable to get a visa to the US, sick, caring for an ill relative, having issues connecting to the internet, etc etc etc. We need to make the same materials available to them that we make to the studnets who can attend.

*The bare minimum is that you record any class meetings and lectures and provide it to studnets who cannot make a synchonous class meeting.* This applies to online, hybrid, and on-campus sessions. Ideally, you will be able to provide students with an engaging course no matter how they are getting the information.

# Technology
There is no mandate to use any particular Learning management system (LMS). NYU has NYU Classes (similar to Canvas/Blackboard/etc), which you are welcome to use. Some faculty prefer github, others like wordpress. Use what works best for you.

NYU uses Zoom for remote instruction. https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/communication-and-conferencing/meetings-chat-conferencing/nyu-zoom.html

We have a service called NYU Stream for sharing videos. You are free to use other services like Youtube and Vimeo as well. https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/instructional-technology-support/video-and-media-creation-presentation/nyu-stream.html

# Classroom setup
Physical classrooms are being equipped with Zoom carts that will have a camera, microphone, speaker, and monitor to accomodate students who cannot attend. Details on this are forthcoming.

# Resources
There are a load of resources that have emerged in the last 5 months for online and remote pedagogy. Tandon and NYU have a coule places for instructional support as well.
